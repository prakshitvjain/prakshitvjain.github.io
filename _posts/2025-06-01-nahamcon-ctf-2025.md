### NahamCon CTF 2025 write-up
Hello folks, this is my first write-up for my first CTF contest, The **NahamCon CTF 2025** by **Ben Sadeghipour** aka **Nahamsec**. I have covered warmup and easy challenges that i was able to solve.

So let’s begin

**Read The Rules** _— warmups_

Challenge description: Please follow the rules for this CTF!

Just curl the rules page from terminal and grep flag

```
curl https://ctf.nahamcon.com/rules | grep flag
```

![Output for the above command displaying the Flag](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/873/1*qU47AMC1hEV_QDSnSqZUxg.png)

**Screenshot** _— warmups_

You are provided with a PNG file **‘Screenshot.png’**

![Given Image for the challenge — A Screenshot](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/873/1*qyCGYmwm9E-NVvJlvvMfig.png)

This screenshot contains a hex dump of a zip file (since it starts with ‘PK’) named ‘flag.zip' that contains a flag.txt  
we are also provided with a password called `password` in the challenge description.

Use below python script to re-create the zip file using the given hex dump!
```

hex_dump = """

""".replace("\n","").replace(" ","")    
    
binary = bytes.fromhex(hex_dump)    
with open("flag.zip","wb") as f:    
   f.write(binary)    
print("flag.zip created successfully!")
# to execute the script, simply type 'python filename.py' in the terminal
```
On successfull execution, the **flag.zip** will be created, unzip it and extract the **flag.txt** using the provided password to get the flag.  

flag{907e5bb257cd5fc818e88a13622f3d46}

**Free Flags!** _— warmups_  

You are provided with a file **‘free_flags.txt’** that contains 3000 flags.

There are a lot of flags in there, but what you need to do is just get the regex from rules page filter all the invalid flags!

```
grep -oE "flag\{[0-9a-f]{32}\}" free_flags.txt
```

This command will highlight and display the only valid flag

![Output for the above command and the flag](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/873/1*A9uj_IU_yYzjszjXvjh1Lw.png)

**Naham-Commencement 2025** _— warmups_

You will be provided a login page and when you try SQL injection or any login attempt, you will be returned with ‘Access Denied! Client-Side Validation failed’

Just Inspect the code and access the java-script file

_To access the JS file: just press Ctrl + click on the script file in the inspector OR move to Debugger => Sources => Main Thread => Static/JS => main.js_

If you look carefully, the user inputs are validated against pre-computed ciphertexts. And the functions perform Caeser Cipher and Vigenere Cipher for username and password respectively.

Ciphertext username : **dqxqcius**   
Perform Reverse Caeser Cipher with a shift of **16**

  
Ciphertext password : **YeaTtgUnzezBqiwa2025**  
Perform Reverse Vigenere Cipher with Key : **nahamcon**

Now use any external website to decrypt these ciphertexts to obtain credentials in plaintext.

username: nahamsec

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/873/1*FwBRlL_AAforWGZzWJi5Iw.png)

password: LetTheGamesBegin2025

When you enter the obtained credentials, the flag will be displayed.

**The Oddyssey** _— warmups_

You will be asked to connect to a netcat server which will display tiny chunks of the Poem Oddyssey and will prompt you to press `<enter>` key for next chunk.

I struggled with this challenge a bit, as it kept going infinitely. But then I figured that, on typing the ‘n’ number of characters and hitting enter, it skips the press `<enter>` part ’n’ times and displays ‘n’ number of chunks in one go.

So I copy pasted a few chunks and hit enter, resulting in display of a huge number of chunks. Then I used ‘find’ to search for the flag.

Better Approach

Execute the following command

```
while true; do echo ""; sleep 0.1; done | nc challenge.nahamcon.com 30132 | grep flag
```

This will send an empty string every 0.1 seconds indefinitely simulating the `<enter>` key.  
The ‘_grep flag_’ will highlight and display the flag.

**Quartet** _— warmups_

In this Challenge, you will be provided with four files.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1171/1*A40vxQtP0FTme5ZCAJeKPg.png)

Challenge Description

If you view the contents of first file in a text editor, you will probably see that it starts with something like ‘**_PK_**’ , it likely means that it is the starting part of an incomplete zip file.

And the hint given with the challenge confirms it! i.e “_a collection of individual parts together_”.

To construct the complete zip file, unzip it and display the flag, use below commands.

```
cat quartet.z01 quartet.z02 quartet.z03 quartet.z04 > quartet.zip
unzip quartet.zip
strings quartet.jpeg | grep flag
```
The flag will be displayed

**SNAD** _— web_

This is a particle simulation challenge, where we’re supposed to “drop grains of sand” with specific colors at specific positions.

Just Inspect the code and access the java-script file.  
_To access the JS file: just press Ctrl + click on the script file in the inspector OR move to Debugger => Sources => Main Thread => JS => script.js_

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1171/1*A_Fkf1uLx4OijkHmZUOdvg.png)


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1171/1*Tz0gmpxeTm1DgLkpSeDIFQ.png)


In the code, you will see that the target positions are given, a function called ‘**_injectSand()_**’ is defined.  
Not gonna lie, but I did use AI to solve this :)

To solve this challenge we need to place the sand exactly at the target positions.

Navigate to **Console** in **DevTools** and type:
```javascript
injectSand(367, 238, 0); injectSand(412, 293, 40); injectSand(291, 314, 60); injectSand(392, 362, 120); injectSand(454, 319, 240); injectSand(349, 252, 280); injectSand(433, 301, 320);
```

Now, return back to the web page, the flag will be displayed

**Cryptoclock** _— Cryptography_

You’ll connect to a remote server using **netcat (`nc`)**, where a Python script (`server.py`) is running and controls the server’s behavior.  
 You’ll be given ‘**server.py**’ to understand how the server works so you can interact with it correctly. 

When you connect with the server, it provides the encrypted flag.

What you also get: the ability to send a text and get its ciphertext.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1171/1*xhn-Y9-725GwzntqNpHzmQ.png)

On analyzing the **server.py** file, we come to know that the server is using **XOR encryption with time based key**. i.e it uses the timestamp to generate the key every session and uses same timestamp as key for that session alone.

We know that the flag is of the pattern **‘flag\{[0-9a-f]{32}\}’** — md5 Hash, So connect to the remote server and get the encrypted flag as well as the ciphertext of a sample flag ‘**flag{afd467a9fcb4e80ea3dr4dr5454fdaa0}**’

Now the close the remote session and based on the steps followed to encrypt the flag, write a script to generate the key and decrypt the flag.

**Logic:**   
XOR your plaintext with your ciphertext result → that gives you the key   
XOR that key with the encrypted flag → you get the original flag in plaintext

Python Script
```python

def XOR_operation(b1, b2):
    return bytes([x ^ y for x,y in zip(b1,b2)])

# Replace the below value with the ciphertext of the original flag
encrypted_flag_hex="6215c6614703787f8717186e1bc2b1567e6d6a0bfe0fec6245ad06f1575d283623a55ec7724c"

# Replace the below value with the ciphertext of the flag you sent to server
encrypted_plaintext_hex = "6215c66147057b2d85164e6d4296b05f25683e0aaf0dbd3915a454f4505d29657ef45c91744c"

# Replace this with the flag you sent to server
plaintext_in_bytes_form = b"flag{6ff0c72ad11bf174139e970559d9b5d2}"

encrypted_flag = bytes.fromhex(encrypted_flag_hex)
encrypted_plaintext = bytes.fromhex(encrypted_plaintext_hex)

key = XOR_operation(plaintext_in_bytes_form, encrypted_plaintext)

flag = XOR_operation(key, encrypted_flag)

print(flag.decode())
```
Executing this script will provide the flag.
(make sure to change the values as per your scenario. But you will still get the flag with these exact values.)

**Flagdle** _— miscellaneous_

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1171/1*pzxt_bP5ziMLqP-PBiJlng.png)

You can manually guess each character until all greens are received as response.  
Start with all **a’**s and go all the way to ‘**f’** followed by **integers** (0–9).  
Replace only the ones that are either yellow or black. keep the green ones untouched.

Use the below command to send the POST request via curl
```
curl -X POST http://challenge.nahamcon.com:30544/guess \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"guess":"flag{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa}"}' 
# make sure to change the PORT
```

Encoding:  
**ud83d\udfe9** — Green  
**ud83d\udfe8** — Yellow  
**u2b1b** — Black

Tip: Have a actual Flag and a rolling Flag, make changes to rolling flag when sending requests and make changes to actual flag only when the characters and their positions are confirmed._

You will eventually reach a point where all the responses are **ud83d\udfe9** i.e Green

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1171/1*-9hm1S8xfOV4XAC9-IQa1w.png)

Hence the flag that returns all greens is your answer!

**The Martian** _— miscellaneous_

You are provided with a file ‘**challenge.martian**’

Perform a ‘**binwalk**’ on the file => extract the files
```
# this will show the possible contents that can be extracted  
binwalk challenge.martian  
# the extracted files will be stored in _challenge.martian.extracted  
binwalk -e challenge.martian
```
A directory ‘**_challenge.martian.extracted**’ will be created, navigate to the directory and you will see there are two JPEG files, that contain the flag.

Files ‘**34**’ and ‘**957D**’ contain the flag
